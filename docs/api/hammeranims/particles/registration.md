# 📝 Registration
In this page we're going to see how particles are stored, registered and accessed.

## 🪣 Particle storage
As usual, particles are stored in container files (usually with `.particle.json` suffix)
Each container may have only one effect stored inside.

To register a given particle container into the game, HammerAnimation provides a separate registry.

Each element of said registry is an instance of `org.zeith.hammeranims.api.particles.IParticleContainer`.

:::tip
HammerLib already provides us with a simple content registration pipeline (see [`📝 Content Registration`](/docs/api/hammerlib/basics/content_registration))

This is what we're going to use to get particles registered properly and easily.
:::

Additionally, there is resource-driven (not data-driven!) way of loading additional particles without explicitly registering them, but this is advised to be kept for resource pack makers only.

## ☕ Registration (Java)

### ⌨️ ModParticles Class
To store our particle containers, create an interface `ModParticles` inside your init package.

The result should look something like this:
```java
package com.yourname.yourmod.init;

import org.zeith.hammerlib.annotations.*;

@SimplyRegister
public interface ModParticles
{
}
```

### 📦 Adding containers
To add a new particle container into the mod, simply create a new field inside `ModParticles` containing the return value of `IParticleContainer.create()`, and annotating the field with `@RegistryName("name")`. The "name" must be unique.
```java
package com.yourname.yourmod.init;

import org.zeith.hammeranims.api.particles.*;
import org.zeith.hammerlib.annotations.*;

@SimplyRegister
public interface ModParticles
{
    @RegistryName("your_particle")
    IParticleContainer YOUR_MODEL = IParticleContainer.create();
}
```

## 🎁 Registration (Resource Packs)
Although this is perfectly possible within a mod (And HammerAnimations does it too for sanity checking), this is suggested to be kept for resource packs.

With that out of the way, first of all you're going to need to make a new json file letting HammerAnimations know what to load...
The file in question will ALWAYS be located in `/assets/hammeranims/bedrock/custom_particles.json`
Put all extra particle effects that you wish to load.

Example:
```json
{
  "load": [
    "yourmod:tornado"
  ]
}
```

This loads particle effect from `/assets/yourmod/bedrock/particles/tornado.particle.json` when reloading resource packs, or via `/hammeranims reload`.

## 🔃 Resource loading
To make the particles actually load, you need to put the effect files into your mod's resources.

They are generally stored in `/assets/yourmod/bedrock/particles/` folder.

Thus, the particle effect from our example should be located at `/assets/yourmod/bedrock/particles/your_particle.particle.json`.
:::tip
If you want to simplify the `.particle.json` suffix to just `.json`, replace `IParticleContainer.create()` call with `IParticleContainer.createNoSuffix()`
